It had a bug which was unexplainable to me by just looking at the code. This project is a service within a microservice architecture that is being developed as part of a course (Look here for details).
One of the services is the so called &amp;ldquo;Game service&amp;rdquo; which is responsible for managing the state of the game and letting players (which are services by themselves) join a game.</description></item><item><title>Twobiers</title><link>https://twobiers.github.io/posts/twobiers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://twobiers.github.io/posts/twobiers/</guid><description>There is a german joke:
Mein Name ist Tobias - englisch f√ºr &amp;ldquo;zwei Bier&amp;rdquo;
Which translates into:
My name is Tobias - english for &amp;ldquo;two beers&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Is The Negation Of Life Goals The Key To Success?</title><link>https://twobiers.github.io/posts/negotiate_life_goals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://twobiers.github.io/posts/negotiate_life_goals/</guid><description>How to set goals in life? Is it really the right approach to say &amp;ldquo;I want to run a marathon&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I want to be successful&amp;rdquo;?
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better if we just step down the latter by setting upper bounds we don&amp;rsquo;t want to pass?
We might stick to the approach of dividing the big goal into smaller pieces like &amp;ldquo;I want to run 5km&amp;rdquo;. If we achieve this goal we increase the goal to &amp;ldquo;I want to run 10km&amp;rdquo; until we match the big goal.</description></item></channel></rss>
