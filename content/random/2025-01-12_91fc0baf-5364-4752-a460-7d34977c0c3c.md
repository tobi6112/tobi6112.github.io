For several years I'm searching for a nice note-taking solution for my personal use. I feel like my requirements are pretty low with:
- Multi-Device sync
- Markdown Bailout
- Web and Android Support
- Good UX, simple to use

Yet, I haven't found one to this day. Now I've found [Supernotes](https://supernotes.app/) and giving it a try. In fact, this part of my blog is now driven by Supernotes Cards. On a daily basis a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/blob/849482d16deae4120b0ddf1e6520457c07457cbb/.github/workflows/fetch-from-supernotes.yml) is running a [script](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/blob/0d90522e3f5b89fb09f5ecbd19c1df6b6737f9b1/hack/fetch-random-from-supernotes.sh) which is fetching all note cards with `#random` and `#blog` tags and storing them in the Git repository driving this blog. Let's see how it evolves over time.
