* Today, by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vBVvQTTdXg), I learned about the [Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) and [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) which are pretty important concepts for the invention of our current computing model using stacks.
  With the polish notations we can formulate a mathematical/logical expression without the need for parentheses by placing operators in front (or behind) the operands.
