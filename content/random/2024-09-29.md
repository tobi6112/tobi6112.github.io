* Today, by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vBVvQTTdXg), I learned about the [Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) and [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) which are pretty important concepts for the invention of our current computing model using stacks.
  With the polish notations we can formulate a mathematical/logical expression without the need for parentheses by placing operators in front (or behind) the operands. 
* Google published a [paper about mercurial cores](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s01-hochschild.pdf). 
  Basically, as a Hyperscaler they observe their CPUs are miscalculating operations sometimes due to e.g. manufactoring issues. This issue occurs so often (a few cores per thousand machines) and is even increasing by pushing the hardware further to the physical limits, that its not a negligable problem.
