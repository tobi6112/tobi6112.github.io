* One skill, I would really like to develop and improve in is listeing to people. 
  [How To Be A Good Listener](https://thought.is/the-myth-of-the-good-listener/) gives great advice to that.

The stability of the Hungarian economy could only be achieved with the introduction of a new currency. Thus, on August 1, 1946, the forint was introduced, which was exchanged at 400 quadrillions (a 4 with 29 zeros; written out 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) peng≈ë.
