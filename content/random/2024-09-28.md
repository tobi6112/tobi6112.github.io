* One skill, I would really like to develop and improve in is listeing to people. 
  [How To Be A Good Listener](https://thought.is/the-myth-of-the-good-listener/) gives great advice to that.
* I've built this random page on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Markdown files](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/tree/83a7ddf8ebc3bc4b7717cf357c16e26270bf76d3/content/random) that contain just lists, a [list layout](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/blob/main/layouts/random/list.html) and [some CSS](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/blob/83a7ddf8ebc3bc4b7717cf357c16e26270bf76d3/assets/css/custom.css#L17-L25).
  However, I could have also used shortcodes like I do for [details](https://github.com/twobiers/twobiers.github.io/blob/83a7ddf8ebc3bc4b7717cf357c16e26270bf76d3/layouts/shortcodes/details.html). This might be a future improvement. Let's see first where we're going.
