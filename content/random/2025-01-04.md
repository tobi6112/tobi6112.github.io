* GNOME now has default shortcuts for switching between applications. Therefore, the Toggle in the "Dash to Dock" extension to disable shortcuts does not work. To disable them, use the command:

   ```
   for i in {1..9}; do gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-$i "[]"; done
   ```
