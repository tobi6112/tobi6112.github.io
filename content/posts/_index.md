As the description already mentions, this is the place where I write 
stupid stuff.
It can vary from IT and coding over music to philosphic thoughts.

I want to emphasize that this blog won't be always correct. I may change my
thinking over time, the blog may not reflect these changes or you won't notice
a change. On this blog I won't publish new patterns or a ground-breaking new 
scientific achievement. Take this blog as a journal, a documentation of my 
personal experiences, that may vary, evolve and change over time.
