I listen to a lot of music. To put it into numbers, according to the [Spotify 2021 Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/) 136,569 minutes in 2021, which are 2,276.15 hours or
6.23 hours a day. Wow!

And as [with great numbers comes great responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility) there must be a way to organize and structure
my obsession. How do I remember my favorite tracks? How do I choose the music for my current mood? How do I categorize my music? How to not drive crazy?

As you might already have guessed, I use Spotify as my main music streaming service - and that is totally correct. The following strategy I want to describe applies to Spotify
and its service features. However, most of the points I make are technology-agnostic and you can apply the concepts to almost any piece of software that allows you to organize
music. Even on the file system or plain paper.

// TODO:
(I am not a neat person, I am chaotic. Looking at my table I see 3 stacked breakfast boards, more than 10 paper memos distributed on the surface and looking to the right I see
laundry I still have to fold and put into the closet. This is not another guide on how to master chaos, it is a documentation on my strategy)
// TODO: Define playlist in terms of this post

# The Outcome

[tl;dr](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)

After reading the post, the following results should have been conveyed.

- Give your playlists an identity
- Introduce a playlist lifecycle
- Put tracks into playlist where you would expect it
- It might not be the best idea to structure playlists around genres and subgenres
- Try more to classify by mood
- It is your playlist, don't think about the others when deciding whether a track belongs to it
- Try to use visual identifiers

# Give Your Playlists An Identity

I think this is the key part for maintaining a valuable playlist. If you just name it **asdfghjkl** and simply fire every track you like into it, you will most likely
come to a point where this playlist feels outdated, you might heard tracks of it enough and don't feel satisfied listening to it. You might create playlist a playlist
called **asdfghjkl2** and start from the beginning.

Stop it!

Don't see your playlists as volatile containers. Your playlist should serve a purpose. What purpose does **asdfghjkl** give you? The name does not imply anything. 
Maybe your action of putting in everything does. But what? You might argue that the identy of this playlist is your current state of music taste and that is 
totally okay if it fits for you, but treat it as such. Name it accordingly so that the name [implies a lifecycle](#introduce-a-playlist-lifecycle) and keep the 
purpose stable.

# Introduce A Playlist Lifecycle

Some playlist identites might need a lifecycle bound to them.

You are planning a vacation trip and want a fresh playlist for the ride? Create a playlist called **Vacation 2022** and the lifecycle will naturally end
after the trip. Stop putting in more tracks after the vacation is over, don't just use it as your daily drive playlist.

You want a playlist that contains your current favorites? Call it **Weekly Favorites** - the lifecycle will end after a week is over.
